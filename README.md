# Covid-19-Statistics-Site
weekend project where we use apis to create graphs on covid-19 in each country  

[COVID WebApp](https://claudeni-covid19.netlify.com/)

## Info
In this project we used 2 apis:
  - [about-corona.net](https://about-corona.net/)
  - [restcountries](https://github.com/hengkiardo/restcountries)
  
And a library [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), to draw a graph.

## Site
In this site, you choose a region you want to view its countries' covid-19 data, after a while of fetching the data, you receive a graph of all the countries.  

You can choose from a couple statistics:
- confirmed cases
- deaths
- recovered
- critical condition

or otherwise you can choose a specific country from that region and see all its statistics at once.
